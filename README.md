# kubectl-interact

kubectl-interact is yet another LLM chatbot that can generate kubectl commands for you.

The only difference is that this kubectl plugin can directly execute kubectl commands after the command generation.

Currently, it only supports granite-3.2-8b-instruct model and does not support Ollama.
